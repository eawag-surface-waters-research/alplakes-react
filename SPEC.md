# Specification

**Name**: Alplakes <br>
**Tagline**: Forecasting and monitoring alpine lakes <br>
**Description**: Alplakes provides 


connects researchers and the public with lake models and remote sensing products produced by the research community.  

provides an updated outlook on the state of lake in the european alpine region. 

We have lots of data and there is lots of data out there and we want to provide it in the way users want to consume it. 

## Goals

- Provide public access to accurate lake forecasts and remote sensing products
- Facilitate use of products and models for research and engineering projects
- Connect users to sources of insitu data 
- Collect, standardise and operationalise new models
- Notify users of events in the lake

## User Stories

#### Recreational lake user

As a keen lake swimmer, I want to know the temperature of the lake so that I can decide which day of the week to swim, where to swim
and whether I should bring my wetsuit. I want to be able to quickly see the temperature measurements and forecasts for my favourite 
swimming locations.

#### Fisherman

As a regular lake fisherman I want to know the temperature and velocity patterns in the lake so that I can better predict where to 
find fish in the lake. I would like to visualise in an intuitive manner and see how it changes over time.

#### Lake manager

As a lake manager I want to be informed of events in the lake (upwellings, blooms etc.) and longer term trends so that I can make 
better management decisions for the lake. 

#### Scientist

As a scientist working on a specific phytoplankton in the lake I want to understand the wider context of what's happening in the lake 
so that I can identify relationships between their behaviour and general lake conditions.

#### Engineer

As an engineer working on a project to divert a river into a lake I want to have access to calibrated lake models so that I 
can simulate the impacts of my project on the lake.
